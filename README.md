## So... what is this?

Well, this is an api which lets the client request a verse from the [Watchtower Online Library](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/h/r1/lp-e) website. ^\_^

## Features

At the current moment in time this api only gets verses in a single language (English).
And that's it really... for now ^\_~

## The Future?

Hopefully I can expand on this concept to something ✨ amazing ✨ which plenty of people can benefit from.

Possible ideas:

- The obvious one, duhhh, would be to allow for different languages.
- Maybe show the footnotes of the verses and cross references.
- Check the discussions for more!

## Deployment

To deploy this to Google Cloud please first make your changes in the dev branch and make a pull request to the production branch so that changes can be reviewed and approved.

Once the change has been approved, you can deploy the app with the command `gcloud deploy app`. To do this you need to have the [GC CLI tools](https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe) installed and initialised to your account.
