## So... what is this?

Well, this is an api which lets the client request a verse from the [Watchtower Online Library](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/h/r1/lp-e) website. ^\_^

## Features

At the current moment in time this api only gets verses in a single language (English).
And that's it really... for now ^\_~

## The Future?

Hopefully I can expand on this concept to something ✨ amazing ✨ which plenty of people can benefit from.

Possible ideas:

-   The obvious one, duhhh, would be to allow for different languages.
-   Maybe show the footnotes of the verses and cross references.
-   Check the discussions for more!

## Contributing

To get started fork this repo, clone it and run `npm i`  
This will install all the packages required for this prject.

When you want to test your changes run `npm run start:dev`  
This will run the nodemon command for the server which will detect any changes that you make and will restart on change.

After making changes please make sure you run this command => `npm run lint`  
Please address any errors or warnings which appear due to this command. Warnings can mostly be ignored and just serve as reminders to get rid of any unnecessary logs or "any" typings.

This will ensure that the code is consistent and will generally keep the codebase clean.
